and framework will be having a control on the execution of the entire application or the code.

What is the difference between library and framework?

They are many frameworks of JS:
dojotoolkit, mootools, backbonejs

What is jQuery?
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp
Javascript can be used to make a request to a server side program
That serverside program can be written in PHP, JSP , ASP.net.
Synchronous====> In synchronous kind of coding the execution will happen in a sequence/
Asynchronous kind of coding we can execute multiple task at a particular instance of
time and where we dont look for completion of one task followed by the other.

In web technology we talk more about aysnchronous programming it will decrease the response
so that we get quicker response.

Why jQuery?
There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.

Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:

Google
Microsoft
IBM
Netflix


jQuery Get Started
Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google

What is CDN?
Content Delivery Network=====> It is basically a network of servers which have the 
various resources ranging from images, script files, CSS file etc. It is a network of 
globally distributed servers.  


jQuery Syntax

With jQuery you select (query) HTML elements and perform "actions" on them.

jQuery Syntax
The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)

this=======> this is to represent the current object.

$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

 Are you familiar with CSS selectors?

jQuery uses CSS syntax to select elements. You will learn more about the selector syntax in the next chapter of this tutorial.

jQuery Event Methods


jQuery Traversing



What is Traversing?
jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.

The image below illustrates an HTML page as a tree (DOM tree). With jQuery traversing, you can easily move up (ancestors), down (descendants) and sideways (siblings) in the tree, starting from the selected (current) element. This movement is called traversing - or moving through - the DOM tree.
